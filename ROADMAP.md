### 🔬 Research & Future Vision

#### DNA-Inspired Skill Storage

**Research conducted**: February 2026

**Concept**: Store and transmit skill definitions using DNA-inspired encoding, enabling biological storage media and extreme data density.

**Key findings from research**:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Encoding** | Quaternary system (A=00, T=01, G=10, C=11) |
| **Density** | 215 petabytes per gram of DNA |
| **Longevity** | Stable for 1000+ years in optimal conditions |
| **Error Correction** | Reed-Solomon codes, biological redundancy |

**Potential applications**:

1. **Archival Storage** - Store skill libraries for millennia
2. **Biological Computing** - Skills executable in biological systems
3. **Extreme Environments** - Space missions, deep archives
4. **Biomolecular AI** - Future bio-silicon hybrid systems

**Implementation phases**:

```
Phase 1: Digital DNA Encoding (software simulation)
         - YAML → DNA sequence conversion
         - Error correction algorithms
         - Validation and testing

Phase 2: Synthesis Integration (lab partnership)
         - Partner with DNA synthesis providers
         - Encode real skill definitions
         - Read-back verification

Phase 3: Biological Execution (research)
         - Explore biological computing
         - CRISPR-based skill modification
         - Bio-silicon interfaces
```

**Current status**: Theoretical research complete, awaiting technology maturation
